Ethos

?The disposition, character, or fundamental values peculiar to a specific person, people, culture, or movement?

The Lightworks Forum and Community is means for Members and Forum users to communicate and exchange information, knowledge and views between individuals and the entire Community.

We want to encourage a a positive, optimistic tone, (except in circumstances where it would be either inappropriate or misleading) and posts, where possible, should be informative and accurate. The availability of Lightworks software for either nothing or a very small payment means that everyone can use the most professional of editing applications. We want this to be fun, and the Forum and Community should reflect this.

 

Lightworks Forum

The Lightworks Forum is the first place to go when you have questions about any version of Lightworks, if you do not have a support contract with Editshare.

The scope of the Forum is limited to discussions about Lightworks, and equipment (such as cameras, computers, storage and I/O that might be used with Lightworks) as well as editing techniques and other areas of technology that may be of interest.

The Forum may be used to discuss the merits of Lightworks in comparison with other products, but you must comply with the rules (below) about accuracy, respect and appropriate language.

Free Lightworks and Lightworks Pro Users should visit the Forum and search for answers to their questions. If searching is not successful then posting a question will normally result in a prompt reply from either an experienced Lightworks user, of an Editshare employee.

Please make sure that you search the forum thoroughly before posting a question, because while the vast majority of users are patient and willing to help, no-one wants to waste time explaining something that has been dealt-with on the forum many times already.

 

Lightworks Pro Community

The Lightworks Pro Community is built on the same platform as the Lightworks Forum and while some features are available to free users, most Community features are only available to those paying for membership.

 

Inaccuracy and defamation.

You must not post inaccurate or defamatory information about the Lightworks or Editshare on Internet forums, blogs or web pages. We welcome the reporting of views on Lightworks, good or bad, but we want to limit the spread of misinformation - malicious or otherwise. It is a condition of use that you do not spread misinformation and that if you are uncertain about any aspect Editshare?s products, services or publications you contact us first.

 

Unsubstantiated and nonconstructive criticism

You must not make unsubstantiated claims or otherwise speak negatively about Lightworks or any other manufacturer's product without substantiating your comment. For example, if you think that a product is ?unusable?, then you must say how it is unusable, for you, in your context.

 

Politeness and Respectfulness

You must always be polite in your Forum and Community posts. However much you disagree with someone, you must address them politely. For example, nobody is ?an idiot?. You may say, however, that you ?are surprised that someone could hold such a view in the light of X, Y or Z.?

You should be polite and respectful even to Editshare?s competitors.

 

Equality and Fairness

We will not allow any content or communication that contravenes Editshare?s own policies, which are, in summary, that there must be no submissions or communications that explicitly or by implication suggest inequality or disadvantage based on race, religion, sexual orientation or disability (handicap). Any content submitted that contravenes these rules will not be accepted and the originator will be banned from the Community and Forum. Where political views are expressed, they must be relevant to the industry and must be clearly flagged as the opinion of the author and not Editshare. Overt political grandstanding will not be acceptable.

 

Negativity

Your contributions must not be unduly negative. The Ethos of the forum is that it is positive and helpful. If you are having problems, then please ask questions in a respectful way.

?This product is rubbish? and ?[Some company] doesn?t know what it?s doing?. Are not acceptable.

?I haven?t been able to make this work for me. Can anyone help?? and ?I think I must have misunderstood this, because I can?t see how it?s supposed to work. What does anyone else think?? are acceptable.

Posts that are considered to be unduly negative will be edited or possibly removed by a Moderator.

 

Language and content

The forum and community are available worldwide, and have a very large number of users, young and old, and from widely different cultural backgrounds. Please be mindful of this. We will edit posts that we consider inappropriate. We have to ensure that language and content is appropriate for a very wide range of users.

 

Advice disclaimer

Editshare does not guarantee that it will give a response for any given issue, and any advice given is only as good as the information that Editshare receives from the user.

While we will always endeavour to be helpful, Editshare does not take any responsibility for the consequences of advice or information given anywhere on the Lightworks Forum or in the Community.

Editshare does not take responsibility for the consequences of any advice or any content whatsoever posted by non-Editshare employees.

As a Forum user or Community member, you have no legal redress to any advice given either by Editshare or other Community Members or Forum users.

 

Moderators

All public posts and communications on the Forum and Community will be monitored by Moderators who work for, or on behalf of Editshare. Any contravention of these terms and conditions will result in posts being edited or deleted. If contraventions are severe or frequent enough, then Community members or Forum users may be banned. Payment for Membership status is an acknowledgement that if these terms and conditions are contravened, the ability by the member to use the Community may be curtailed by a moderator without recourse to a refund of the outstanding part of the Membership payment. The ability to use the Pro version of Lightworks software will be unaffected.

Members who are banned or in other ways restricted from using the forum may write to the Community and Forum Administrators to discuss their case, and if the Administrators conclude that the contravention was either unintentional or caused by a genuine misunderstanding, the Member may be reinstated.

It is not Editshare?s intention to restrict the freedom of discussion on the boards, as long as these terms and conditions are followed by users.
